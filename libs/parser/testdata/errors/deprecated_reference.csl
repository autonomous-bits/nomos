# Error Test Fixture: Deprecated Top-Level Reference Syntax
#
# This file demonstrates the DEPRECATED top-level reference syntax that should be
# rejected by the parser. Top-level references were never actually used in practice
# and are being removed to simplify the language.
#
# DEPRECATED (should fail):
#   reference:alias:path
#
# CORRECT (inline reference):
#   key: reference:alias:path
#
# Expected Behavior:
# - Parser should reject all top-level reference declarations
# - Error message should indicate that references must be used inline as values
# - Each top-level reference should be reported as an error

# Test Case 1: Simple top-level reference
# Should fail: references cannot be declared at top level
reference:configs:database.host

# Test Case 2: Reference with nested path
# Should fail: references must be assigned to a key
reference:network:vpc.cidr_block

# Test Case 3: Reference with deeply nested path
# Should fail: even complex paths don't make top-level references valid
reference:storage:bucket.name

# Test Case 4: Multiple references in sequence
# Should fail: all of these should be reported as errors
reference:app:settings.timeout
reference:infra:region
reference:data:source.connection_string

# Note: The correct usage would be:
# database_host: reference:configs:database.host
# vpc_cidr: reference:network:vpc.cidr_block
# bucket_name: reference:storage:bucket.name
